A Program to demonstrate the use of @RequestMapping annotation attributes params, headers:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ApplicationController1.java
* ApplicationController2.java
* ApplicationController3.java
* ApplicationController4.java
Notes:
* @RequestMapping annotation accept eight attributes those are name, value, path, method, params, headers, consumes, produces
* The params attribute is mainly used for narrowing the primary mapping.
* This params attribute can accepts array of String values, it can be supported at class level as well as method level also.
* If how many params is defined at method level then that many params have to pass otherwise handler method will not invoked.
* If how many params is defined at class level those are inherits to method level also.
* The headers attribute is also used for narrowing the primary mapping.
* This headers attribute can accepts array of String values, it can be supported at class level as well as method level also.
* If how many headers is defined at method level then that many headrs have to pass otherwise handler method will not invoked.
* If how many headers is defined at class level those are inherits to method level also.
